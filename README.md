Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to assist in exercise selection for rehabilitation purposes. The model utilizes a synthetic dataset generated to simulate patient data, enabling the development and testing of a model without compromising patient privacy.

Files
synthetic_rehab_data(1).csv: The synthetic dataset used for training and evaluating the model.
synthetic_dataset(create)(1).ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for generating the synthetic dataset.
exercise_selection_for_rehab.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
Dataset
The synthetic dataset includes features relevant to patient rehabilitation, such as patient demographics, injury type, severity, and recovery progress. The data is generated using a specified distribution to mimic real-world data characteristics.

Model
The exercise_selection_for_rehab.ipynb notebook outlines the machine learning model development process. This includes:

Data preprocessing and exploration
Feature engineering
Model selection and training
Model evaluation
Usage
Generate Synthetic Dataset:
Run the synthetic_dataset(create)(1).ipynb notebook to create the synthetic dataset.
Train and Evaluate Model:
