Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a model that can recommend appropriate exercises based on patient data, injury type, and rehabilitation goals. The synthetic dataset used in this project was generated to simulate realistic patient scenarios and corresponding exercise recommendations.

Dataset
synthetic_rehab_data(1).csv
This CSV file contains the synthetic data used for training and testing the model.
It includes features such as patient demographics, injury type, severity, and recommended exercises.
The dataset was generated using the notebook synthetic dataset(create)(1).ipynb.
Notebooks
synthetic dataset(create)(1).ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to generate the synthetic dataset.
It includes the data generation process, feature creation, and data preprocessing steps.
exercise selection for rehab.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains the model development and training process.
It includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
